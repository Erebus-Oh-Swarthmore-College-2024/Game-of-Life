**Notes:
    Lab 9 will be an extension of this lab. There is one detail of your
implementation that will cause some problems in Lab 9. It's good that
you only call malloc twice, but can you fix the implementation such
that you don't have to copy the data from new board back into the old
board? Let me know if you want some help figuring this out!
